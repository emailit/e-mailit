E-MAILiT offers publishers the best tool to power social sharings, increase engagement, and earn new revenue.

== Description == 

**Updates 9/29/2015**. A supercharged update, bringing you the best mobile and desktop social sharing experience.

Sharing anything, anywhere, made easy.

E-MAILiT is an innovative social sharing platform which smartly combines a mixture of share buttons, media solutions, and analytics. It offers unique tools to web publishers (news websites, blogs, publishing brands), and helps them to get the most of their website (both desktop and mobile). Publishers all around the world use E-MAILiT’s highly customizable social sharing tools to boost their traffic, increase their audience engagement, promote their content, and generate revenue.

E-MAILiT started as a nights and weekends side project by graphic designer Nikitas Georgopoulos and his team, and quickly grew to a hyper-growth bootstrapped start-up. Up until now, it counts 1.6 billion share buttons served to-date and 20 million people per month who interact in 240 countries worldwide. Over 250,000 web publishers have trusted E-MAILiT share buttons, in any website (custom coded built, Joomla, WordPress, Drupal). E-MAILiT stands out because of its core values and the most important value is to be unique through creativity and innovation.

Publishers choose E-MAILiT because it is easy to install and offers in-depth customization to satisfy all styles. Publishers praise the smart and fast customer support in their reviews, and constantly provide positive feedback regarding the absence of bugs. Additionally, the majority of our publishers are enjoying the fact that E-MAILiT is free. Some of the most popular unique tools that E-MAILiT features is the Add Your Logo and After Share Promo. The Add Your Logo feature enables the publisher to present his logo on the widget share menu, and the After Share Promo feature generates revenue and creates new promotion horizons for the publisher. E-MAILiT has also the fastest loading time among its peers. For detailed peer analysis, please check the chart: https://www.e-mailit.com/def_net_ad/vs/competition

E-MAILiT is changing the way content is shared across the open web, making the world more connected. Build killer share buttons without coding. No other social sharing platform can compete this! Try E-MAILiT at http://www.e-mailit.com

E-MAILiT’s share buttons use HTML5 and CSS3 valid code. This well-engineered code does not encumbers the loading of any web page. Asynchronous loading ensures a fast page launch and as the button script loads at the end, there is no wait period. E-MAILiT supports HTTPS / SSL and it will automatically use the current page's protocol. The result is a fast-loading and super-lightweight button which is caching via major global CDNs. During the installation process, the javascript code is generated, and then can be copied and pasted into any website. Alternatively, if the webpage is built with a leading CMS platform (WordPress, Drupal, Joomla, Tumblr, Blogger), the share buttons can also be installed by using the appropriate widget.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
<h4>Do I need to edit html or javascript?</h4>

There is no need to edit any line of code.

<h4>How do I eliminate/remove the plugin from certain page(s) or post(s)?</h4>

When editing a post or page, you can check the "E-MAILiT" option in "screen options" to enable E-MAILiT remove meta box.

<h4>How do I activate / de-activate your plugin?</h4>

Please, read the guide here http://wordpress.org/plugins/e-mailit/installation

<h4>How do I link the Facebook Like Button or the Tweet Button to my pages?</h4>

Facebook Like Button displays the likes about a specific url. In order to show correctly your likes you must place the button in the right place. If you haven't inserted the button in your home page, propably your likes are linked to it. If in case this is valid, by placing the button in your home page you will see the correct like counter for your site.

<h4>Facebook Share Button seems to show an incorrect number! Why?</h4>

The count result is common for share and like interactions. Please, see here https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/like-button/ There are counters for posting an article or sharing a page content. These are two seperate different interactions. But you can include the Share button next to the Like button, having more sharing options to display on your website and not feeling confused about the similar counters. You will have two different buttons together, with one counter only to display.

<h4>Disclaimer</h4>

E-MAILiT is an advertising-supported service, which means that we are able to offer many of our services without charge to you by displaying advertising on our platform and on partner websites. Revenue generated from these ads supports E-MAILiT. We're displaying these targeted ads (this feature is optional and can be turned off anytime or you can use it exclusively for you by monetizing your website through a share button like ours, also for free) so we can continue offering free products and services that help you expand your awareness and generate money too! Delivering and maintaining such a platform to you is expensive but if you don’t want to participate we perfectly understand!
